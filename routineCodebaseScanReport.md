## Key Findings

1. **Missing Critical Files**: Several files referenced in the codebase and previous fixes are missing, suggesting incomplete implementation or documentation.
2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Multiple error handling approaches exist, creating potential reliability issues.
3. **Incomplete Process Management**: Despite previous fixes, some process management features are not fully implemented.
4. **Logging Inconsistencies**: Logging implementation varies across files with potential impact on performance.
5. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Some input validation and path sanitization could be strengthened.
6. **Testing Gaps**: Test coverage appears incomplete with some critical components lacking tests.
