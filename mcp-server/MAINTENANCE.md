# Windsurf Task Master MCP Server Maintenance

## JSON Parsing Errors and High CPU Usage Fix

### Problem Description

The Windsurf Task Master MCP server was experiencing:
1. JSON parsing errors during communication with Windsurf
2. High CPU usage, especially during disconnections
3. Improper shutdown when Windsurf disconnected

### Root Causes

After analysis, we identified the following root causes:

1. **Complex Logging System**: The original logger implementation included complex formatting, context objects, and color formatting that interfered with JSON-RPC communication.

2. **Stdout-Stderr Separation Issues**: The complex stdout-stderr separation logic was causing JSON parsing errors due to improper handling of stdout and stderr streams.

3. **Improper Shutdown Handling**: The server wasn't properly detecting and handling stdin end events, leading to hanging processes and high CPU usage.

### Implemented Solutions

#### 1. Simplified Logger Implementation

Replaced the complex logging system with a minimal `SimpleLogger` that:
- Writes directly to stderr
- Uses a simple timestamp-based format
- Avoids complex formatting and color codes that could interfere with JSON output

#### 2. Simplified Stdout-Stderr Separation

- Removed the complex validation and caching logic
- Ensured clean separation of JSON-RPC messages (stdout) and logs (stderr)
- Simplified error handling to prevent EPIPE errors

#### 3. Improved Server Shutdown Process

- Created a dedicated `server.js` entry point to handle server startup and stdin end detection
- Implemented robust shutdown logic to ensure proper cleanup of resources and listeners
- Added error handling for uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections

### Verification

The fixes were verified using a test script that:
1. Sends various JSON-RPC messages to the server
2. Monitors CPU usage during operation and shutdown
3. Simulates a Windsurf disconnect to verify proper shutdown

Test results showed:
- No JSON parsing errors for valid messages
- Proper error handling for invalid messages
- Low CPU usage (0%) during operation and shutdown
- Clean termination when stdin ends (simulating Windsurf disconnect)

### Implementation Details

#### Files Modified:

1. **logger.js**
   - Replaced with a simple logger implementation that writes directly to stderr

2. **stdout-stderr-separation.js**
   - Simplified to ensure clean JSON output on stdout and logs on stderr

3. **message-handler.js**
   - Improved JSON parsing with better error handling

4. **index.js**
   - Simplified message handling and improved shutdown logic

#### Files Added:

1. **server.js**
   - New entry point that handles stdin end detection and ensures proper shutdown

### Best Practices for Future Maintenance

1. **Keep It Simple**: Avoid complex logging and stream handling that could interfere with JSON-RPC communication.

2. **Proper Stream Separation**: Ensure stdout is used exclusively for JSON-RPC messages and stderr for logs.

3. **Robust Shutdown Handling**: Always implement proper detection and handling of stdin end events to ensure clean shutdown.

4. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections.

5. **Testing**: Regularly test the server with various message types and monitor CPU usage to ensure stability.
