# Critical Fix for MCP Server JSON Parsing Error

## The Root Cause

The "Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position 4" error was caused by **log messages being written to stdout instead of stderr**. In the MCP protocol, stdout is reserved exclusively for JSON-RPC messages.

## What Was Happening

1. Your server was writing log messages (like `[WARN] Approaching error threshold`) directly to stdout
2. These messages were getting mixed with JSON-RPC messages
3. Claude Desktop tried to parse the entire stdout stream as JSON
4. When it encountered non-JSON text, it threw the parsing error
5. The error recovery mechanism created more errors, leading to a spiral effect

## The Fix

The comprehensive fix includes:

1. **Strict Stdout/Stderr Separation**
   - All logging is redirected to stderr
   - Only valid JSON-RPC messages are allowed on stdout
   - Added validation to prevent non-JSON from reaching stdout

2. **Fixed Error Recovery**
   - Prevents runaway error counts
   - Adds pattern detection to identify error loops
   - Properly resets error counts on success

3. **Safe JSON-RPC Writing**
   - Created a dedicated function for writing JSON-RPC messages
   - Validates all output before sending to stdout
   - Provides proper error handling

## How to Apply the Fix

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/lewisae/Documents/VSCode/windsurf-task-master

# Make the script executable
chmod +x apply-comprehensive-fix.sh

# Run the fix
./apply-comprehensive-fix.sh

# Restart your MCP server and Claude Desktop
```

## Why This Works

The MCP protocol requires:
- **stdin**: For receiving JSON-RPC requests from Claude Desktop
- **stdout**: For sending JSON-RPC responses back to Claude Desktop
- **stderr**: For all logging, debugging, and error messages

By ensuring strict separation, the JSON parser in Claude Desktop will only ever see valid JSON-RPC messages.

## Testing the Fix

After applying the fix:
1. You should no longer see log messages mixed with JSON in stdout
2. The "Unexpected non-whitespace character" error should be resolved
3. All logging will appear in your terminal's error output (stderr)

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, you can rollback:
```bash
cd /Users/lewisae/Documents/VSCode/windsurf-task-master/mcp-server
cp src/index.js.backup src/index.js
cp src/utils/error-recovery.js.backup src/utils/error-recovery.js
```

This fix ensures your MCP server properly follows the protocol specification and prevents stdout pollution that causes parsing errors.
