# Security Guidelines for Windsurf Task Master

This document outlines security measures, best practices, and guidelines for maintaining and extending the Windsurf Task Master system securely.

## Security Measures Implemented

### Path Traversal Protection

The system implements strict validation for file paths to prevent path traversal attacks:

- Project IDs are validated using a regex pattern (`^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$`) to ensure they only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores
- Paths are normalized and validated before use to prevent directory traversal attacks
- A dedicated security utility module provides path sanitization functions

### Input Validation

The system uses comprehensive input validation to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity:

- Zod schemas with strict validation rules for all user inputs
- Validation for task IDs to ensure they're positive integers
- Length limits on string inputs to prevent buffer overflow attacks
- Consistent validation across all tools and core components

### Error Handling

The system implements secure error handling to prevent information disclosure:

- Custom error classes for different error types
- Standardized error handling to prevent leaking sensitive information
- Redaction of sensitive information in error messages
- Structured logging for security-related events

### Dependency Security

The system includes measures to manage dependency security:

- Regular updates of dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Use of specific dependency versions to prevent unexpected changes
- Minimal dependencies to reduce the attack surface

## Security Best Practices

When extending or maintaining the Windsurf Task Master system, follow these security best practices:

### File System Operations

- Always use the security utilities for path validation and sanitization
- Never directly concatenate user input into file paths
- Use the `getProjectDirPath` and `getTasksFilePath` functions for path construction
- Validate all file paths before use

### Input Handling

- Always validate user input before processing
- Use the Zod schemas for input validation
- Add appropriate validation rules for new input fields
- Be cautious with regular expressions to avoid ReDoS attacks

### Error Handling and Logging

- Use the custom error classes for different error types
- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- Use the logger utility for consistent logging
- Redact sensitive information before logging

### Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Run `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Review new dependencies before adding them to the project
- Keep dependencies to a minimum

## Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Windsurf Task Master system, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. Document the issue with steps to reproduce
3. Contact the maintainers directly
4. Allow time for the vulnerability to be addressed before disclosure

## Security Updates

The Windsurf Task Master system will be regularly updated to address security vulnerabilities. To stay secure:

1. Regularly check for updates
2. Apply security patches promptly
3. Review the changelog for security-related updates
4. Run security audits periodically

## Security Checklist for New Features

When adding new features to the Windsurf Task Master system, use this checklist:

- [ ] Input validation is comprehensive and strict
- [ ] File paths are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Error handling follows security best practices
- [ ] No sensitive information is exposed in logs or error messages
- [ ] Dependencies are reviewed for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Code is reviewed for security issues
- [ ] Security tests are added for the new feature
